#### No time
- [ ] textures
- [ ] bloom effect
- [ ] collision detection
- [ ] 3D??
- [ ] visualize direction with arrow and past with line (important for debugging)
- [ ] offload computation to gpu (compute shaders?)
- [ ] parallelisation

#### TODO:

- [ ] Plot system energy (potential + kinetic) *Use relativistic mass*
   - [ ] Add cache?
- [ ] add header comments/comment python files
- [ ] plot center of mass
- [ ] Add help markers


##### Experiments
###### basic
- Orbital periods for known systems:
  - earth/sun
  - earth/moon
  - pluto/charon
- Average distance for known systems
- Analytical solution for simple system

##### better
- kinetic + potential energy
