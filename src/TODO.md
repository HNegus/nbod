#### Done
- [X] camera control
- menu:
    - [X] zoom
    - [X] position
    - body params control:
      - [X] velocity
      - [X] position
      - [X] mass
      - [X] radius
      - [X] color
    - [X] time display
    - [X] add body
- [X] figure out how to center
  - [X] remove global variables other than const
  - [X] make use of gui class
- [X] add shortcuts
- [X] scenario class (save/resume)
  - [X] figure out savefile format
- [X] plot history as lines
- [X] put shaders in own directory
- [X] Finish import/export
- [X] Make configuration editable
- [X] Enable planet tracking

#### No time
- [ ] textures
- [ ] bloom effect
- [ ] collision detection
- [ ] 3D??
- [ ] **visualize direction with arrow and past with line** (important for debugging)
- [ ] **figure out shader use** (compute shader? what can i do with fragment shaders)

#### TODO:
- [ ] **parallelize**
- [ ] clean code
- [ ] fps counter
- [ ] timestep control
- [ ] control number of calculations per frame
- [ ] Plot system energy (potential + kinetic) *Use relativistic mass*
- [ ] Work on simulation stepping (how does time work??)
- [ ] **logging data to files**
- [X] Remove body
- [ ] Make history display more efficient
   - [ ] Add cache?
- [ ] Add logging capability
- [ ] add header comments
- [ ] Distinguish between saves and scenes
- [ ] statically link everything
- [ ] plot center of mass


##### Experiments
###### basic
- Orbital periods for known systems:
  - earth/sun
  - earth/moon
  - pluto/charon
- Average distance for known systems
- Analytical solution for simple system

##### better
- kinetic + potential energy
